Today when I was cooking, I listened to the episode of “Austin Kleon on Writing, Creativity and The Importance of Idleness” from podcast “Not Overthinking”. I think this has also motivated me to do blog. Here are a few points that I learned: Blog is different from writing a summary/diary on a personal laptop where no one else would see. The idea that someone will see your post or article would change the way you articulate and organize. If you write something every day, someone would say you must be good at writing. It may be the opposite. You write because you allocate yourself some time every day. And even if you struggle, you keep doing this. Show “how I do this” instead of “how to do this”.","link":"/2020/11/10/hello-world/"}],"tags":[{"name":"book","slug":"book","link":"/tags/book/"},{"name":"movie","slug":"movie","link":"/tags/movie/"},{"name":"2020","slug":"2020","link":"/tags/2020/"},{"name":"summary","slug":"summary","link":"/tags/summary/"},{"name":"podcast","slug":"podcast","link":"/tags/podcast/"},{"name":"mood","slug":"mood","link":"/tags/mood/"},{"name":"blog","slug":"blog","link":"/tags/blog/"}],"categories":[{"name":"SUMMARY","slug":"SUMMARY","link":"/categories/SUMMARY/"},{"name":"EVERYDAY THOUGHTS","slug":"EVERYDAY-THOUGHTS","link":"/categories/EVERYDAY-THOUGHTS/"}]}
